\section{Yummy Future}

My name is Cole Fuerth, and I am very interested in Yummy Future! I have a passion for hobbyist electronics and coffee (I love coffee shops), and would love to contribute to making a robotic shop a reality. I have a ton of hobbyist experience with Arduino, Raspberry Pi, ESP/STM32, and most electronics involved with 3D printing, electric bikes, and general remote control aircraft; I make all of these myself, mostly from scratch. My native languages are C++ and Python, and I have an excellent understanding of data structures and low level operations. I was in the top 5\% of students in most of my classes through Computer Science, and the top student in all of my Electronics Engineering degree. I do have degrees in both CS and EE, and I grew up on a farm where I worked on a lot of machines; I have a deep understanding of mechanical systems. I am looking to relocate to the US from Canada, so relocation to Illinois is something I am interested in. That said, I have a lot of experience with both hardware and software, and feel I would be a great fit for this role, as I have tangible experience with every aspect in the job description, a high degree of interest in every aspect of this position, and a passion for learning new skills.
