I am a machine learning engineer that dabbles in (almost) every field I can! My backkground in AI is entirely research-based, I was a research assistant heading up multiple projects for the University of Windsor for 2 years. I would always prefer working on a project using a cool new concept I learned over video games any day. My native languages are C and Python for Embedded and Machine Learning respectively, with Java as a close third, but I pick up most concepts very quickly, and start integrating every skill I can into my projects.

I have two notable projects that I would like to share with you:

The first is an AI battery characterization algorithm that I developed for my capstone project. It uses a combination of machine learning and signal processing to determine the state of charge, state of health, and state of power of a battery pack. It is currently being used by the University of Windsor's BMSLabs Team to characterize their battery packs.

The second is a from-scratch CNN on the MNIST dataset. I built it to learn how CNNs work, implemented from scratch using only NumPy. Each layer was implemented manually, and it learned with an ~80\% accuracy. I have since learned how to use TensorFlow and SkLearn, and have been using them for my projects since.
